# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.

# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).

# The combination of xss-lock, nm-applet and pactl is a popular choice, so
# they are included here as an example. Modify as you see fit.

# xss-lock grabs a logind suspend inhibit lock and will use i3lock to lock the
# screen before suspend. Use loginctl lock-session to lock your screen.
exec --no-startup-id xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- i3lock --nofork

# NetworkManager is the most popular way to manage wireless networks on Linux,
# and nm-applet is a desktop environment-independent system tray GUI for it.
exec --no-startup-id nm-applet


# Start i3bar to display a workspace bar (plus the system information i3status
# finds out, if available)
